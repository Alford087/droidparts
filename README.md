DroidParts
----------
is a carefully crafted Android framework that includes:
* *DI* - dependency injection for Views, resources, etc.
* *SQLite* object-relational mapping.
* *JSON* (de)serialization.
* Improved *AsyncTasks* with Exceptions, progress & result reporting.
* Better *logger* (log any object without a tag).
* *RESTClient* for GETting, PUTting, POSTing, DELETing & InputStream-getting, also speaks JSON.
* *ImageAttacher* to asynchronously attach images to ImageViews, cross fade support.
* Numerous *Utils*.
* Support for *Fragments*, both native and [ActionBarSherlock][1]-based.
