DroidParts
----------
a carefully crafted Android framework that includes:
* *DI* - dependency injection for Views, resources, etc.
* *SQLite* object-relational mapping.
* *JSON* (de)serialization.
* Improved *AsyncTasks* with Exceptions, progress & result reporting.
* Better *logger* (log any object without a tag).
* *RESTClient* for GETting, PUTting, POSTing, DELETing & InputStream-getting,
also speaks JSON.
* *ImageFetcher* to asynchronously attach images to ImageViews, with
caching, cross-fade & transformation support.
* Numerous *Utils*.
* Support for *Fragments*: native, support-v4 and [ActionBarSherlock][1]-backed.
